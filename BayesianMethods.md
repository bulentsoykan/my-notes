## Introduction
Bayesian methods are a set of statistical techniques that are based on the idea of using prior knowledge to make predictions about future events. They are often used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to make predictions about the future based on past data. Bayesian methods are also used in statistics to estimate parameters of a probability distribution. ()
