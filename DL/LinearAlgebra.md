## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

A **vector** is a list of numbers. We can think of a vector as a point in space, with each element of the vector specifying the coordinate along a different axis.
Each vector is an ordered tuple of 'n' real numbers, representing a point or a direction in 'n'-dimensional space. 

A **matrix** is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identified by two indices instead of just one. We can think of a matrix as a grid of numbers, with each number in the grid identified by a row and a column.

A **tensor** is an array with more than two axes. We can think of tensors as multi-dimensional arrays. A scalar is a tensor with zero axes, a vector is a tensor with one axis, and a matrix is a tensor with two axes.
