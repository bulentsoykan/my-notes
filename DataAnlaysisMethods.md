# 17 Essential Types of Data Analysis Methods

1. **Cluster Analysis:** A statistical method used to group data points into clusters where items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

2. **Cohort Analysis:** A subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given dataset and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis.

3. **Regression Analysis:** A statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables.

4. **Factor Analysis:** A technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors. This method is especially useful in survey research.

5. **Neural Networks:** A series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

6. **Data Mining:** The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data. The data source may include databases, data warehouses, the web, etc.

7. **Text Analysis:** Often referred to as text mining, it is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. It involves the structuring of the input text and the identification of patterns.

8. **Time Series Analysis:** A statistical technique that deals with time series data or trend analysis. It helps to understand the underlying factors leading to a particular trend in the data.

9. **Decision Trees:** A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

10. **Conjoint Analysis:** A statistical technique used in market research to determine how people value different attributes that make up an individual product or service.

11. **Correspondence Analysis:** A data visualization technique for picturing the relationships among categorical variables in a dataset.

12. **Multidimensional Scaling:** A means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset by plotting them in a low-dimensional space.

13. **Content Analysis:** A research method for studying documents and communication artifacts, which might be texts of various formats, pictures, audio or video.

14. **Thematic Analysis:** A method for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data. It minimally organizes and describes your data set in detail.

15. **Narrative Analysis:** This method involves the interpretation of narratives that individuals provide, analyzing the story or content of the narrative.

16. **Grounded Theory Analysis:** A research method that operates almost in a reverse fashion from traditional research and at first looks at the data.

17. **Discourse Analysis:** A method used to analyze written, vocal, or sign language use or any significant semiotic event.
